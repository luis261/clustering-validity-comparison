# About
This repository contains code to benchmark different clustering validity metrics regarding their application on density-based clusterings.  
The approach used to compare the metrics is the one described in [this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Relative-clustering-validity-criteria:-A-overview-Vendramin-Campello/ad93d3b55fb94827c4df45e9fc67c55a7d90d00b)
  
The implementation of DBCV that is used is this fork: https://github.com/luis261/hdbscan
